Source: Thai Cooking Made Easy Cookbook

### Serves 2 | Prep Time: 10 Minutes | Cook Time: 10 Minutes

### INGREDIENTS:
- 8 oz boneless and skinless chicken (breast or thighs, cut into strips or thin pieces)
- 20 canned straw mushrooms
- 1 1/2 cups coconut milk
- 1 cup water
- 1 stalk lemongrass (cut into 3-inch lengths and pounded)
- 6 kaffir lime leaves (lightly bruised to release the flavor)
- 6 slices galangal
- 8 bird’s eye chilies (lightly pounded)
- 3 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 1/2 tablespoon lime juice (or to taste)
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

### METHOD:
1. Add water, lemongrass, galangal, chilies, kaffir lime leaves into a pot and bring it to boil. Add straw mushrooms and chicken and boil it on medium heat for a few minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Add coconut milk and boil for a couple more minutes. Turn off the heat and add lime juice and fish sauce to taste. Add chopped cilantro before serving.


#### COOK’S NOTE:
If you can’t find galangal, do not use ginger. Ginger is not the substitute for galangal. “Tom Kha” means galangal in Thai. However, if you absolutely can’t find galangal and still wish to make this because you love this soup so much, just make it without galangal.
