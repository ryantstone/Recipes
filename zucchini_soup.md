# Zucchini and Yellow Squash Soup with Rosemary and Parmesan - Pressure Cooker or
Stovetop

### Ingredients:
- 2 T olive oil
- 1 T butter (or use more olive oil if you don't want butter)
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 T minced fresh garlic
- 1 tsp. Italian Herb Blend (I love Italian Herb Blend from The Spice House, but most brands are similar)
- 4 tsp. chopped fresh rosemary or frozen rosemary (or can use 2 tsp. finely chopped dried rosemary, but fresh or frozen rosemary will be much better)
- 3 lb. diced green and yellow summer squash (about 8 cups diced squash or slightly less if you can't fit that much in your pressure cooker, can also use
- all green or all yellow squash)
- 6 or 8 cups vegetable stock or chicken stock (I use my own homemade chicken stock; use 6 cups for pressure cooker or 8 cups for stovetop.)
- salt and fresh-ground black pepper to taste 
- fresh grated Parmesan cheese, for serving

### Instructions:
Chop the onion, mince the garlic, and finely chop the fresh rosemary.

1. Heat olive oil and butter in large heavy soup pot or stovetop pressure cooker
(or in the bottom of the electric pressure cooker on the Saute setting), then
add onion and saute about 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent and
softened. Add garlic, rosemary, and Italian Herb Blend and cook 3-5 minutes
more.  While the onion, garlic, and rosemary are cooking, chop up enough
zucchini and yellow squash to make 8 cups (or slightly less for the electric
pressure cooker if you can't fit that much.)

2. Add the vegetable or chicken stock to onion mixture and simmer 10 minutes.
(Use 6 cups stock for pressure cooker or 8 cups for stovetop. For the electric
pressure cooker I kept the setting on Saute to simmer the stock.)  Then add
chopped zucchini and yellow squash.  For stovetop cooking,  turn heat to very
low and simmer 30 minutes, or until squash is very soft and flavors are well
blended.  For electric or stovetop pressure cooker, lock the lid, bring to high
pressure, and cook 5 minutes at high pressure.  Use the quick-release method to
release the pressure.

3. Use an Immersion Blender to puree the mixture, or work in batches and puree in
food processor or blender. (Be careful if you're using the blender or food
processor and don't fill them too full when blending hot liquids.) When mixture
is as pureed as you'd like it, check the consistency of the soup.  Simmer until
the soup is reduced and as thick as you'd like it.  (Simmer about 20 minutes on
medium low on the stovetop or stovetop pressure cooker or about 20 minutes on
Saute in the electric pressure cooker.  This time may vary, depending on how
thick you want it.)  Season to taste with salt and fresh-ground black pepper. 

4. Serve soup hot, with freshly grated Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top if
desired.
