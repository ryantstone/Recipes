### Time
Serves 4 
Prep Time: 5 Minutes
Cook Time: 10 Minutes


### INGREDIENTS:
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 small onion, quartered
- 2 lbs skinless and boneless chicken breast or chicken thighs, cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste (Mae Ploy brand)
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
- 6 slices galangal, optional
- 6 kaffir lime leaves, torn and bruised, optional
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce or salt to taste
- 1 heaping tablespoon sugar
- 3/4 cup coconut milk
- 2 1/2 tablespoons lime juice
- Cilantro leaves

### METHOD:
Turn on the Saute mode on your Instant Pot. Add the onion and saute for 10 seconds before adding the chicken. Saute the chicken until the surface turns white. Add the Thai curry paste, bell peppers, galangal and kaffir lime leaves (if using), stir to mix well. Add the chicken broth, fish sauce and sugar. Cover the pot and select High pressure for 10 minutes.
When it beeps, turn to Quick Release. When the valve drops, remove the lid carefully, add the coconut milk and lime juice to the soup, stir to mix well. Top with cilantro and serve immediately.

### COOK’S NOTE:
If you don’t have an Instant Pot, you can add all ingredients in the slow cooker (except coconut milk, lime juice and cilantro) and slow cook for 4-6 hours. Add the coconut milk, lime juice and cilantro when it’s done cooking. You may also cook the soup on a stove. The steps are the same, except that you use a regular soup pot to cook. You may want to slowly simmer the chicken soup for about 15-20 minutes before you add the coconut milk, lime juice and cilantro.
