### [Originally from Saveur](http://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/fricasse-de-pollo-cuban-style-chicken-stew)

### Ingredients
- 1⁄4 cup fresh lime juice
- 1⁄4 cup fresh orange juice
- 3 cloves garlic, lightly smashed
- 1 (3 1⁄2–4-lb.) chicken, quartered (backbone discarded or saved for stock)
- 1⁄3 cup olive oil
- 1 large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced
- 1 large white onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 lb. russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
- 1⁄2 cup cup jarred alcaparrado or 1⁄3 cup pimento-stuffed olives and 2 tbsp. capers
- 1⁄4 cup raisins
- 1 cup frozen peas, defrosted
- 1 (8-oz.) can tomato sauce
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Steps
1. Toss lime and orange juices, garlic, chicken, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; chill 1 hour.
2. Heat oil in an 8-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; pat dry using paper towels and reserve marinade. Working in batches, cook chicken, flipping once, until browned, 8–10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. Add bell pepper and onion to pan; cook until soft, 6–8 minutes. Add wine; cook, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan, until reduced by half, 5–7 minutes. Return chicken to pan and add reserved marinade, potatoes, alcaparrado, raisins, tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and 1⁄2 cup water; boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, covered, until chicken and potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in peas before serving.
